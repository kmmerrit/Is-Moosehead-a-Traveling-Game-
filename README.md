# Is-Moosehead-a-Traveling-Game-
This is an experimental design and analysis project from my time as a graduate student at CSULB.

This is a project a partner and I worked on for a class at CSULB. We took a rather common midwest game typically played at
parties and designed an experiment to determine if certain criteria affected the difficulty of the game. In particular, we 
looked at the distance of the game, the type of coins involved, and the playing surface. Our experiment included three 
players with three replications each leading to a 2 cubed factorial design with 3 replications.
